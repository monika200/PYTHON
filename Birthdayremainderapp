 *Birthday Reminder App using Python*
 
 Here I have used a dictionary data type in Python for real-life work by making a birthday reminder app in Python.
 
# Overview of Project:
+ Users can add birthday data to the program and can search for particular data.
+ Simple user interface with 3 prompts for searching, inserting data and exiting the program.

Logic:
1. We will give choice to user for what operation they want to perform.
2. Like add a birthday, look a birthday.
3. And for each look query we will first check if we have data and if we have
    we will look in our dictionary.
4. If found we will print.
5. Add for adding, we will add data as key value pair.

Improvement to Project:

There is a lot that can be done to improve this project.

You can connect it with sqlite3 database to store data permanently or even use files to store data. Because in the above code once you close the program data goes away.
One command can be used to list all the data in the database.
A GUI version of the app can be made.
You can add alert mail/message when someone's birthday approaches.
